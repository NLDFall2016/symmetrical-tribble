### Rachael's NLD repository

MIT licensed unless otherwise specified, meaning you can use the code
  more or less however you want, with proper attribution (basically my name - see [LICENSE](https://github.com/NLDFall2016/symmetrical-tribble/blob/master/LICENSE)).

## Organization

Each homework assignment will have its own folder, but modules for specific
  functions will be stored in `modules/` for ease of access across assignments.

Functions are documented in `modules/docs/`.
